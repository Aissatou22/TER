## Add these servers to your Git:
	- This is our main git repository: https://github.com/ImaneLamriou/TER.git
	- `git remote add origin https://github.com/ImaneLamriou/TER.git`: This command is to add main git repository of our project to pull from.
	- `git remote -v`: This command is to verify all remote servers

## Don't forget:
To do this command every time that you'll work on the project:
	- `git pull origin master`
